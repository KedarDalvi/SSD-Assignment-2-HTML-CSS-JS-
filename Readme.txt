Description:

├── Q6/ → Global Event Tracker (captures all clicks and page views)
├── Q7/ → Bowling Alley Game using A-FrameJS / ThreeJS
└── Readme.txt → Root-level documentation


Assumptions:

- Each folder is self-contained and can be opened independently.
- Supporting assets (CSS/JS/images) are placed inside their respective folders.

Working:
Open the respective index.html file in each folder to view and test the solution.
For Q2, open index.html → it links to both ssd.html (original) and newssd.html (redesigned).
For Q6, use the browser console to view captured event logs. Added the Q6 script to each of other questions.
