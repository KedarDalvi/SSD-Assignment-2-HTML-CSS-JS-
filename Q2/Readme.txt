Project Title:
Software System Development (SSD) — Course Website Transformation

Description:
This project contains the original SSD course webpage (ssd.html) and a redesigned version (newssd.html). The redesign improves the visual layout and usability using CSS and JavaScript while keeping all existing information intact. An index.html file provides navigation links to both versions to prevent 404 errors when hosted on GitHub Pages.

How it is built:
The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

ssd.html is the original single-page website.

newssd.html is the improved version with a modern design.

style.css adds visual styling and responsiveness.

script.js provides dynamic features such as clock, last-updated info, and smooth scrolling.

index.html serves as a landing page with hyperlinks to both versions for GitHub Pages hosting.
